HONG KONG — As Toshiba, the embattled technology giant, battles for survival, it has turned to a group led by the Japanese government to buy its prized microchip business, although its plans still face a legal challenge by an American business partner.After weeks of jockeying among suitors, Toshiba said that it hoped to reach a formal sale agreement over its semiconductor business by next Wednesday, in the process raising much-needed cash. The company did not disclose terms of the potential deal, but analysts have estimated the value of the memory chip unit at about $20 billion.Such a deal would significantly bolster the fortunes of a titan of the Japanese economy at one of the lowest moments in its century-long history. Steep losses in its American nuclear power division, Westinghouse Electric, have cast “substantial uncertainty” over the company’s ability to function as a going concern, it says.By picking the Japanese consortium — its members include the Innovation Network Corporation, a state-backed investment fund, as well as the American buyout firm Bain Capital and the Development Bank of Japan — Toshiba is hoping to conclude a sale quickly. The company is hoping to reach a deal ahead of its annual shareholder meetingToshiba said in a statement that the group presented “the best proposal,” in terms of price, promises to keep employees and ability to keep sensitive technology within the country. The last of those was considered an important point, since a Chinese winner would have raised concerns by Japanese government officials about trade secrets seeping out of Japan.A host of others had bid for the Toshiba memory business, from the iPhone supplier Foxconn to the American chip maker Broadcom to the Korean semiconductor producer SK Hynix.The dearth of Japanese bidders in the early rounds of the memory chip auction spurred the Japanese government to cobble together a group.But potentially standing in the way of a deal is Western Digital, the American data storage company that owns part of a Toshiba semiconductor factory in Japan and has argued that it has a say in any deal. Western Digital, which had also made a bid for the memory business, asked a California state court to block any sale while also pursuing arbitration in the Paris-based International Court of Arbitration.A hearing is scheduled for July 14.“We remain confident in our consent rights and our legal position and look forward to the hearing for injunctive relief,” Western Digital said in a news release.Toshiba has rejected that argument and said that it has the right to pursue a sale.
