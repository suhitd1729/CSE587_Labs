It seems Americans are losing their collective sweet tooth: Nestlé is considering selling less candy in the United States.Butterfingers, Crunch bars and Gobstoppers could go on the market as the Swiss company considers its options, including a  sale of its American candy division.The candy business could be worth as much as $3 billion in a sale, The Wall Street Journal reported, based on analysts’ valuations of similar businesses.At that price, it could be attractive to private equity firms, the writers at Bloomberg Gadfly say. Or to Mondelez International, which made an unsuccessful bid for Hershey last year.Nestlé’s United States candy business has waned as American demand for sweets has fallen off, racking up about $922 million in sales last year in what the company described as a “disappointing” performance.The chief executive, Mark Schneider, took over in January and has pushed the company into healthier foods.Nestlé said it would continue to sell goods like pet food and bottled water.If Nestlé does divest its American candy business, the move could add to consolidation in an industry that has been trying to cut costs through deal-making.A company that started out as a cult hit, growing by word of mouth, could soon be valued at around $5 billion.Slack, an office messaging company, is in advanced talks to raise $500 million, according to two people with knowledge of discussions.It has also fielded interest from buyers, including Amazon, Google and Microsoft, according to people with knowledge of the offers.The talks were earlier reported by Recode, and Amazon’s interest was reported by Bloomberg.The funding could come in handy as competition intensifies.Microsoft recently introduced a rival product called Teams that is bundled with Office 365, and Facebook has a work collaboration tool that is free to many users.A woman who was raped by an Uber driver in India filed a lawsuit against the company and against three current and former executives after revelations that they had obtained and mishandled her medical records.The woman, identified only as Jane Doe, is a resident of Texas. She is suing Uber; its chief executive, Travis Kalanick; and two former senior executives, Emil Michael and Eric Alexander, for intrusion into private affairs, public disclosure of private facts and defamation.She said the executives believed that her rape may have been part of a conspiracy hatched by a competitor.“Rape denial is just another form of the toxic gender discrimination that is endemic at Uber and ingrained in its culture,” said Douglas Wigdor, the lawyer representing Ms. Doe.The man who raped Ms. Doe in 2014 is serving a life sentence for kidnapping and sexual assault. At the time of the case, Uber executives were publicly contrite.In private, investigators and Uber employees obtained and discussed the woman’s medical records as the case progressed, according to three people familiar with the matter.Uber has pledged to overhaul itself after months of scandal and accusations of turning a blind eye to sexual harassment and other corporate misbehavior.
