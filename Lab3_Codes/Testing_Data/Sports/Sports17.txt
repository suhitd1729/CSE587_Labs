By now you may have heard about, or even seen for yourself, the various demonstrations of protest made by N.F.L. players on Sunday, as well as by a Major League baseball player on Saturday.These events occurred shortly after President Trump, in a series of tweets, “urged owners to fire players who do not stand for the national anthem, suggested that football is declining because it is not as violent as it once was and seemed to disinvite the N.B.A. champion Golden State Warriors from the traditional White House visit because of their star player Stephen Curry’s public opposition to him.” Then on Sunday, Mr. Trump called for a boycott of the N.F.L. if team owners didn’t stop their players from protesting during the playing of the national anthem.What is your reaction to Mr. Trump’s statements? Why?In “Trump Calls for Boycott if N.F.L. Doesn’t Crack Down on Anthem Protests,” Julie Hirschfeld Davis writes:Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:— Do professional athletes have the right to make political statements while they are on the field, on camera or otherwise at work? What about in their personal lives?— Do you think that kneeling during the national anthem shows “disrespect” to the flag or is unpatriotic? Do you agree with those who think it is “inappropriate”? Why or why not?— Or, do you think, as a New York Times editorial argues, that the players who have joined the protest to raise awareness of police brutality and racial injustice are “the real patriots”? (As the Seattle Seahawks put it in a statement issued before a game on Sunday, “We will not stand for the injustice that has plagued people of color in this country. Out of love for our country and in honor of the sacrifices made on our behalf, we unite to oppose those that would deny our most basic freedoms”?)— If you were a player in the N.F.L. right now, what do you think you might do? Why?— Do you think President Trump is justified in making these public attacks on professional sports leagues, teams and individual players? What about his call for a boycott?— Marc Short speaks of a “double standard” in which high school coaches are punished if they lead their team in prayer on the field before a game but a professional athlete who takes a knee during the national anthem “is presumed to be a martyr for a social cause.” Do you think this is a fair statement? Why or why not?— Last week we asked you about the controversial statements made by Jemele Hill, and some argued that politics and sports should be kept separate. Do you agree with this? If so, how do you think that could, or should, happen?Students 13 and older are invited to comment.
