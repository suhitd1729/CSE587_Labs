Here’s a look at what’s coming up this week.MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGYThe private jets are headed to Sun Valley, Idaho, once again for the technology and media conference that begins on Tuesday and is run by the investment bank Allen & Company. The gathering is renowned as a place for the industries’ top chiefs to bond over golf and rafting — and potentially strike merger deals. The pending union of AT&T and Time Warner (whose chiefs have been invited to attend) has fueled speculation that Lowell McAdam, Verizon’s chief executive and a regular invitee, will approach one of his colleagues on the media side about a potential acquisition. Michael J. de la MercedECONOMYJanet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, could be making her final appearances before Congress on Wednesday and Thursday when she testifies about the Fed’s biannual report on monetary policy. Ms. Yellen’s four-year term as chairwoman ends in February, and President Trump has not indicated whether he plans to nominate her for a second term. The report, published on Friday, recapitulated the Fed’s view that these are neither the best of times nor the worst of times. The economy is growing steadily, but faster growth remains elusive because of persistent problems like weak wage growth, a dearth of corporate investment and the slow pace of productivity growth. The hearings are also likely to include a large dose of sparring about regulatory issues. Ms. Yellen has lately been taking every opportunity to make the case for preserving the financial regulations imposed after the 2008 crisis. Congressional Republicans argue those strictures are limiting economic growth. Binyamin AppelbaumWith oil prices depressed and the Canadian economy sluggish, many economists had assumed that the Bank of Canada would not raise its key lending rate until sometime next year. But recent statements by Stephen Poloz, the central bank’s governor, have now raised expectations that a rate increase may come as soon as Wednesday.Speaking with CNBC late last month, Mr. Poloz said that during the first quarter, Canada’s economy showed “really strong growth, surprisingly so.” The country’s economy grew at a 3.7 percent annual pace. The bank cut its overnight rate to 0.5 percent two years ago, and it has stayed there since. “It does look as though those cuts have done their job,” Mr. Poloz said in the interview. Some major Canadian banks have increased some of their consumer rates since then. One factor that may work against a central bank increase is that inflation remains well below its target of 2 percent. Ian AustenOn Friday, at 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department will release data on consumer prices in June. The Consumer Price Index is expected to be flat overall, with core prices, excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, rising 0.2 percent.Economists will be watching this indicator more closely than usual, as the inflation rate has been falling short of what many experts had expected, indicating a slightly less robust economy. If the number comes in below expectations, it could prompt policy makers at the Federal Reserve to rethink their promise to keep raising interest rates later this year. Nelson D. SchwartzBANKINGOn the heels of a resoundingly successful stress test, and after announcing big dividend increases late last month, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo will report their second quarter earnings on Friday. Expectations are for a strong quarter across the board as banks have largely regained their footing since 2008. President Trump has promised to roll back post-recession banking regulations, so many large financial institutions are anticipating more flexibility in their lending practices, even as the Fed is expected to continue to raise interest rates.
