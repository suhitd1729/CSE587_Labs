WASHINGTON — A former C.I.A. officer, actress Jennifer Lawrence, her director and a veteran New York Times reporter who covered the fall of the Soviet Union discussed spy craft, Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election and the difficulties of developing a Russian accent.The Academy Award-winning movie star and the director, Francis Lawrence, joined TimesTalks as they promoted their new film, “Red Sparrow,” which chronicles how a young ballerina was trained by Russian intelligence services as a seductress “honey pot” aiming for C.I.A. agents.Given the real-life backdrop of the continuing investigation into whether Russian intelligence agencies outsmarted American intelligence services to help get Donald J. Trump elected president, the movie is fortuitous.But in the panel discussion at the Newseum, blocks from the White House and the Capitol, Mr. Lawrence described how concerned he was three years ago that the tension between the United States and Russia in the movie felt contrived and outdated.Ms. Lawrence talked about how in the months before they shot the movie, she spent several hours a day learning to dance ballet. The former C.I.A. officer and master of disguises, Jonna Hiestand Mendez, explained how the Kremlin has, indeed, used sex to get information from Americans. And The New York Times reporter, Scott Shane, explained how he was once recruited by the C.I.A. because he was learning Russian as a student in Cold War-era Leningrad. He didn’t join.Here are some highlights from the night.The Russian intelligence agencies did have a school where they taught women to use sex as a seduction tool, Ms. Mendez said. In the 1980s, she said, an American Marine who guarded the American embassy in Moscow fell prey to a Russian sex operation. A female Russian spy seduced the Marine, who ended up allowing other Russians onto the embassy’s property in Russia. The Marine was later convicted of allowing a security breach.“It was a seduction scenario not unlike what you would have done in your movie,” Ms. Mendez said, referring to Ms. Lawrence.Ms. Mendez said that spies from China, Taiwan and Czechoslovakia had used sex to seduce sources. But the C.I.A., she said, did not teach those tactics.“That doesn’t mean there haven’t been some entrepreneurs here and there,” Ms. Mendez said coyly, adding that in her time at the agency, she knew of a woman who had lost her job after falling in love with a foreign asset.A couple of men at the agency had also found themselves in similar situations, but had kept their jobs, she said.Mr. Lawrence said he had been told that, or read that, the C.I.A. tried to create its own sparrows program in the 1960s to use against the Russians.“It didn’t work because of the difference in terms of values and morality around sex” he said. “They just didn’t care as much, and it didn’t work and it was scrapped.”Ms. Mendez responded, “Those reasons would be reasons it wouldn’t work but I never heard it was attempted.”As the directors and producers started working on the movie’s script three years ago, they grew concerned that the idea of tension between the United States and Russia did not feel relevant.“We thought, ‘God, this Cold War thing doesn’t feel all that relevant,’” Mr. Lawrence said. “Uh, maybe we should brainstorm a little about making it more relevant.”He added, “We sort of set that aside and went with the character story.”Mr. Shane jumped in, “And the world came to you.”Mr. Lawrence insisted, “It is really about the people, right, but it’s not a political movie.”“But as we were shooting and actually prepping,” he added, “this all started to come up, and the movie became more and more relevant as we’ve progressed.”When Ms. Lawrence prepared for the “Hunger Games” movies, she spent her time practicing the use of her weapon, a bow and arrow. For “Red Sparrow,” she studied ballet and developed a slight Russian accent.“Even just to play an ex-ballerina, everything had to change,” she said, adding that she spent three hours a day for four months working with the Hollywood ballet instructor Kurt Froman.Ms. Lawrence said it was difficult because she had never wanted to dance ballet.“We tried to condense a lifetime of training into four months, and we got arms, fingers, and a little bit of head,” she said. “It was most important to move and hold my body differently, and get behind a dancer’s mental and physical discipline.”The movie was always going to be in English, but to enhance the believability of her character onscreen, Ms. Lawrence needed to develop a slight Russian accent. She was assigned to an instructor who studied the voices of women who had come to the United States many years ago from Russia but still had slight accents.That preparation was “very boring,” she said.Mr. Shane quipped, “It’s easier to do that than to learn Russian.”Amid all the spy talk, we learned an incredibly juicy detail about Ms. Lawrence’s dating life: She once dated a hamburger — in a commercial.“Until I did my research, I had not seen your Burger King commercial,” Mr. Shane asked.“Oh, my God — oh, my God!” Ms. Lawrence responded.“It’s out there on YouTube,” Mr. Shane said.In the commercial, Ms. Lawrence plays a teenage girl who is in the bedroom of a teenage boy — who happens to be a Whopper Jr.The boy’s father, who is dressed as a Whopper, walks into the room as Ms. Lawrence and the Whopper Jr. start cuddling.“What’s going on?” the father said. “First, you sell yourself for a buck, and now this.”“Stop treating me like I’m on the kids’ menu,” the son responded.“You get your buns downstairs right now.”Ms. Lawrence said she was 15 when the commercial was shot.“You had real stage presence as a hamburger,” Mr. Shane said.“I wasn’t the hamburger,” Ms. Lawrence said about the commercial. “My boyfriend was a hamburger.”
